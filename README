my-screen --- Screen manager for Emacs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. About
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Switchable window-configurations that persist between sessions.

It has nearly same functionality as elscreen
http://www.morishima.net/~naoto/software/elscreen/
Differences are:
- Configurations are saved to files (this way they're kept between sessions)
- There's unlimited number of screen configurations (each has to have
  distinct name)
- No tab controls (I don't think you need them anyway)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Put `my-elisp' helpers (see my other projects) into folder  named 'my' within
  your load path.

- Put `my-screen' project into your load path

- Create '.my' folder within your '.emacs.d' (you may choose different
  path but then you'll need to override `my-screen-dir' variable)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Initialization
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(require 'my-screen/my-screen)
(my-screen-init)

To load existing screen or to start new screen session press C-z s and input
name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Interaction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keyboard bindings:

C-z s <name> -- Switch (to new or saved) screen in current frame.

C-z o <name> -- Load (new or saved) screen into new frame.

C-z r <name> -- Rename current screen.

C-z d -- Delete current screen.

C-z c -- Unload screen. Save current screen and stop managing frame.

C-z n -- Print name of current screen

C-z h -- Show help (list all keyboard bindings)

And that's it. Periodical or on exit saving of screens is done automatically.
