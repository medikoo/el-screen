my-screen --- Screen manager for Emacs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. About
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Switchable screen configurations that persists between sessions.

It has nearly same functionality as elscreen
http://www.morishima.net/~naoto/software/elscreen/
Differences are:

- Configurations are saved to files (this way they're kept between sessions)

- There's unlimited number of screen configurations (each has to have
  distinct name)

- No tab controls (I don't think you need them anyway)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Put `my-elisp' helpers (see my other projects) into folder  named 'my' within
  your .emacs load path.

- Put `my-screen' folder in same path

- Create '.my' folder within your '.emacs.d' (you may choose different
  path, then you'll need to override `my-screen-dir' variable)

3. Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Initialization
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(require 'my-screen/my-screen)

If it's first run then you start with screen named "" (empty string) 
otherwise screen that was previously opened is loaded.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Interaction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keyboard bindings:

C-z s <name> -- Switch between screens. Current screen is saved, new screen is
                loaded

C-z r <name> -- Rename current screen.

C-z n -- Print name of current screen

And that's it. Periodical or on exit saving of screens is done automatically.
